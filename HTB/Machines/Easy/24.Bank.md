## Intro

1. Directory brute force to get credential
2. Bypass File Upload Filtering
3. Finds files that is executable using an sid instead of a uid

## Enumeration

### Port scanning

```
PORT   STATE SERVICE VERSION
22/tcp open  ssh     OpenSSH 6.6.1p1 Ubuntu 2ubuntu2.8 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0)
53/tcp open  domain  ISC BIND 9.9.5-3ubuntu0.14 (Ubuntu Linux)
80/tcp open  http    Apache httpd 2.4.7 ((Ubuntu))
```

### Directory brute force

dirbuster => /balance-transfer

open .acc file what have different size from others

/balance-transfer/68576f20e9732f1b2edc4df5b8533230.acc

Email: `chris@bank.htb`
Password: `!##HTBB4nkP4ssw0rd!##`

## Exploitation

create php reverse shell

look at this comment in page source

```
<!-- [DEBUG] I added the file extension .htb to execute as php for debugging purposes only [DEBUG] -->
```

use .htb instead of .php for reverse shell

upload shell, use netcat listener

## Privilege Escalation

Finds files that is executable using an sid instead of a uid. In Linux, files that run with an sid are run as the file owner as opposed to the current user.

```
find / -perm -u=s -type f 2>/dev/null
```

When executing `/var/htb/bin/emergency`, a Bash shell is returned
